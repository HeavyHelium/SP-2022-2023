as sang by Taylor Swift
i walked to the door with you, 
  the air was cold, 
  but something about it felt like home somehow, 
  your sweet diposition my wide-eyed gaze, 
  something, 
  something, 
  something, 


  something, 
  <i don't know the lyrics>
  and you were giving me the cat keys, fuck the patriarchy, 
  something, something, something
